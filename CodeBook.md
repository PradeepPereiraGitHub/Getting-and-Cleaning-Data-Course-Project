ALL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN BELOW ARE FOR A WINDOWS 8 OPERATING SYSTEM

Data Processing Pre-Requisities:

The data for this assignment is available for download at

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

1. The above file is to be downloaded and unzipped to the default data directory for a standard R Studio install.

2. All files for the project are to be extracted using the default directory setting while un-zipping. This will create the following parent directory in the above mentioned default data directory
.\getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.

3. All processing in the runanalysis.R script has been coded to source the requisite data files from the above directory.

Data Files Used In Processing:

## X_train.txt

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
